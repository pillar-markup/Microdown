# Microdown Syntax
The syntax covers two distict categories - inline and paragraphs. - Inline commands cover things like emphasis and links.- Paragraphs are commands that span several lines of text (lists, code examples, etc).## Inline syntax### Text emphasis- **bold** is done by `**bold**` (You can get \** by `\\**`)  - _italics_ is done by `_italics_` (should be underline, but now it stuck, there is no underline)- ~strike~ is done by `~strike~`- `inline code` is done by   \`inline code\`### Links and Figure- [Link](https://Pharo.org) is done as `[Link](https://Pharo.org)`. The produced link will open in the standard browser (Pharo `WebBrowser class >> #openOn:`)- ![alt text](https://pharo.org/web/files/pharo-logo-small.png) is done using ` ![alt text](https://pharo.org/web/files/pharo-logo-small.png) `.  Often larger figures are done by placing using this syntax on a line by itself### Microdown specials- $x^2$ - inline $\LaTeX$ is done using `$x^2$` (and `$LaTeX$`).- {{**bold**}} can be done also using raw### Microdown inline extensionsThere is potentially an endless number of extensions one would like to add to Microdown. Rather than keep inventing new syntax, the generic syntax for inline syntax is:`{!extensionName|parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2&parameter3=value3!}`. What the extension does will typically depend on the vistor ($\LaTeX$ generation, Text generation, HTML generation etc)Some extensions are already defined in the Microdown library:- **inputFile|path=uri** - insert the contents of the microdown document at uri at this place.- **footnote|note=some note which goes to the foot**  - adds a footnote the the generated document- **citation|ref=somewhere so others can find it** - adds a reference to the generated document## Microdown Paragraphs### HeadersHeaders are done by lines starting with `#`. One `#` is the largest header, six `######` is the smallest header. The header text is written after the `#` signs.`##### This is a header level 5, done as `##### This is a header level 5` ### CommentsIt is possible to put comments in the Microdown source. Lines starting with `%` are ignored by the parser% They really are### Quote blocks> Lines starting with `>` are supposed to be rendered in an indented manner> At present the in-image rendering leaves something to be desired>  But it works for nowEach source line which is part of the quote block need to start with a `>`### Unordered listsUnordered list are made by prefixing a line with '-' or `*`.* item 1- item 2* It is possible to make a long item  with several lines of text by indenting the following lines   by 2 spaces (two!, not three or one or tab)#### Indented lists* Item 1  * by prefixing the `-` or `*` by two spaces, one indent the list by one level    * Item 1.1.1  * Item 1.2* Againg, the indentation is two spaces!    * If you indent by say 4 spaces instead of two, it is just seen as a new line in the preceding bullet point### Ordered listsOrdered lists are done by prefixing a line with a digit followed by `.` or `)`.2. First item4) The numbers need not be in order, the rendering will start the numbering from one and increment### Mixed listsIt is possible to mix the two types of lists1. This is first item, made using `1. This is first item`   - sub item   * Indenting sublist is tricky, but the bullet (`*` or '-') must be matched up under the first letter in the line `This is the ...`      In this case 3 spaces of indentation `1._`1. Next numbered item### Horizontal lines***Are created by a single line starting with at least three `*` - this works: `***` as well as `*************`*************### Code blocksTo show code one use a tripple  backquote```text  ```pharo	Metacello new		repository: 'github://svenvc/zinc/repository';		baseline: 'ZincHTTPComponents'; 		load.  ``````produces:```pharo  Metacello new    repository: 'github://svenvc/zinc/repository';    baseline: 'ZincHTTPComponents';    load.```#### Predefind language modifiersThe `pharo` modifier used above is good for pharo expressions. Often one will show a full method,  and should use `method` to get a better highlighting and coloring of the method header```text  ```method    accept: aVisitor           ^ aVisitor visitCode: self  ``````produces:```methodaccept: aVisitor 	^ aVisitor visitCode: self```Plain unformatted text us made by using the `text` modifier, which will just print the body as is.```text  ```text    accept: aVisitor           ^ aVisitor visitCode: self  ``````produces:```textaccept: aVisitor 	^ aVisitor visitCode: self```### TablesIt is possible to write tables in markup. These tables are intended to be short and not too wide. The cells of the tables can only be markedup with inline markup.```text| Header1 | Header2 | Header 3 || --- | ---- | --- || cell 1 1 | cell 1 2 | cell 1 3 || cell 2 1 | cell 2 2 | cell 2 3 |```produces:| Header1 | Header2 | Header 3 || --- | ---- | --- || cell 1 1 | cell 1 2 | cell 1 3 || cell 2 1 | cell 2 2 | cell 2 3 |**Notice**, unlike some other markdowns, Microdown requires lines to start with `|`. There has to be at least the `---` in the line after the header. Leaving out the second line merely produce a table without header highlighting.| Header1 | Header2 | Header 3 || cell 1 1 | cell 1 2 | cell 1 3 || cell 2 1 | cell 2 2 | cell 2 3 |
